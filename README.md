### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jamila - iOS Engineer. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been focusing on now.

# [Healthy meals recipes](https://github.com/JamilaRuz/HealthFoodRecipe)
This iOS mobile app is designed for individuals who maintain a healthy diet by preparing specific nutritious meals. It allows users to easily organize a variety of healthy recipes into categories and plan them into their weekly meal schedule. The app retrieves the latest data by making API calls to the server and uses scheduled server requests to keep the information up-to-date and refreshed.
